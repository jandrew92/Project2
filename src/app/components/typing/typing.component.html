<!-- keypress (unlike keyup) doesn't get special keys like capslock, backspace, etc, but it does get enter, so at least that's all i'll have to handle -->

<p>
    <!-- here we'd want the sample text the user is trying to type -->
    {{inputText}}
</p>

<p>
    <span id="output" [innerHTML]="textHTMLContainer"></span>

<p>
    <span id="test"></span>
    {{indexPointer}}
    {{sampleText[indexPointer]}}

<div id="timer" *ngIf="timerDisplay">{{time}}</div>
